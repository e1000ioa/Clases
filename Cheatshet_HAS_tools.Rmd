## Cheat Sheet 1

### Git

  A free and Open source distributed version control system designed to handle coding projects, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
  
  Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.
  
  User can Clone entire repositories in their own machines, every user essentially has a full backup of the main server. Each of these copies could be pushed up to replace the main server in the event of a crash or corruption. In effect, there is no single point of failure with Git unless there is only a single copy of the repository.

### GitHub

 GitHub is a website that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
 
 Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
 
### GitKraken 

GitKraken Client is the most popular Git client (a software that uses Git) in the world and the only one that comes equipped with both a  graphical user interface and command line interface. It offers a convenient interface to perform collaborative tasks more comfortable. 

### Python
Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isnâ€™t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today. A survey conducted by industry analyst firm RedMonk found that it was the second-most popular programming language among developers in 2021 


### Conda
Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment manager, because conda is also an environment manager.

### Vscode
Visual Studio Code is a source code editor, with support of many languages. 

### Jupyter
The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.
