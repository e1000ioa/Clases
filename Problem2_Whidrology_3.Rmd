## Problem 1

**1. Clear Lake has surface area of 708,000 m2 (70.8 ha).  For a given month, the lake has an inflow of 1.5 m3/s and an outflow of 1.25 m3/s.  A +1.0-m storage change, or increase in lake level was recorded.  If a precipitation gage recorded a total of 24 cm for this month, determine the evaporation loss (in cm) for the lake.  Assume that seepage (deep drainage) loss is negligible.  (10 pts)**
